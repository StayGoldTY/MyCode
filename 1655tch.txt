preserved
Description :                                              
	 *** Tue Feb 3 17:26:32 EST 2015 *** ahill ***  16.5.4 PL03

A LDM was generated from a CDM. In the LDM, the attributes of a composite 
key were changed via the relationship join. If new attributes are created 
in the CDM and then generated to the LDM, the modification previously 
made in the LDM is ignored and the change is undone.

To reproduce:

1) create an entity with three attributes
2) make attribute_1 a primary identifier
3) add a recursive relationship
4) generate CDM to LDM
5) in the LDM, open the relationship_1 properties
6) change the Child Attribute from 'ENT_ATTRIBUTE_1' to 'ATTRIBUTE_1' 
(click OK)
7) in CDM, add Attribute_4 to Entity_1
8) generate CDM to LDM with Preserve Modifications selected

NOTE: the LDM is updated as expected

9) in CDM, add Attribute_5 to Entity_1
10) generate CDM to LDM with Preserve Modifications selected

NOTE: ENT_ATTRIBUTE_1 is selected to be created in the LDM again. This is 
a bug.

From Chris Baker

My OS is the standard SAP Windows 7 x64 installation.

I have 2 external monitors on a docking station with the laptop closed.  
Have the right hand display be the primary.

See in bug directory the screen grab of my whole desktop configuration.

reproduction steps:
1.       Extend the desktop across 2 displays
2.       Set display 2 to the left of display 1 or set primary monitor to 
thr right one
3.       Move PD to display 2 and then open the properties dialog.

Description :                                 
	 Incident: 1089821 / 2014
DHR: 5050167184
Customer: Petrobras

PowerDesigner environment:
PD Client version: 16.5 SP04 PL01
Repository DB: Oracle 11g
Repository access type: Both Repository Proxy (ODBC) and Direct Acces 
(Oracle Native Client)
Repository Proxy Version: 16.5 SP04 PL01
PowerDesigner Portal: 16.5 SP04 PL01

Brief Description:  
When the feature Update Model From Database is used, PowerDesigner shows 
some differences related to the position of the indexes within tables.

Below is the original query of SqlListQuery used to reverse indexes from 
Oracle 11g DBMS:
 
select
i.table_owner,
i.table_name,
i.owner,
i.index_name
from
all_indexes i
where
not exists (select 1 from all_constraints k where k.constraint_name
=i.index_name and k.owner=i.table_owner and k.table_name = i.table_name
and k.constraint_type in ('P', 'U') and rownum=1)
and i.join_index = 'NO'
and i.dropped != 'YES'
[ and i.table_owner=%.q:SCHEMA%]
[ and i.table_name=%.q:TABLE%]
order by 1,2,3,4
 
If the same query is changed excluding the order by clause (please see 
below), the PD won’t report differences for indexes positions:
 
select
i.table_owner,
i.table_name,
i.owner,
i.index_name
from
all_indexes i
where
not exists (select 1 from all_constraints k where k.constraint_name
=i.index_name and k.owner=i.table_owner and k.table_name = i.table_name
and k.constraint_type in ('P', 'U') and rownum=1)
and i.join_index = 'NO'
and i.dropped != 'YES'
[ and i.table_owner=%.q:SCHEMA%]
[ and i.table_name=%.q:TABLE%]
 
**The same thing happens for Keys.
 
The feature request is based in a change in the SqlListQuery of Index and 
Key objects to remove the ORDER BY clause used.
 
Please refer to the WordDoc ‘FR-Ignore Indexes and Keys Sort Order.docx’ 
for more the details.

Description: 

Incident: 988395 / 2014 
DHR: 5050166819
Customer: Petrobras

Differences between the engineering reverse from PowerDesigner and 
imported ERWin model regarding the Keys and Indexes. 

The physical model imported from ERWinand the Primary Keys and Unique 
Keys are created as constraints in the ERWin model, when the model is 
imported to PD it automatically creates indexes for those PKs and UKs 
(AKs) and links those indexes to their respective keys in PowerDesigner, 
but when is performed Reverse Engineering from PD of an Oracle DB it only 
show the Keys and not the related Indexes.

Once those models that were imported from ERWin to PowerDesigner are 
being compared against an Oracle database, and PowerDesigner will show 
differences for those type of indexes in each table. 

Obs: PowerDesigner does not retrieves indexes of PKs and UKs when it 
perform reverse engineering of a database, and this should be 
shown/displayed in the same way from imported ERWin model or when 
performing a reverse engineering of a db as It can cause 
problems/confusion when customer compare the model against the database. 

Maybe could be included a simple check/uncheck option of reversing them 
if a customer opts for not having those kind of indexes in their model.

According to Laurent Pommier this issue it's fixed in PD 16.5 SP05. We 
need to port the same fix on top of PD 16.5 SP04 PL.

Subject: RE: Consult about PD 16.5 Incident 947079 / 2014 / External 
Shortcuts Synchronization/Update Problem

Hi Jesica,

I belong to PD dev team and we already exchanged with Paulo about this 
bug. I already had a look into the code and found the bug.
There is no real work-around except stop using full shortcut or do not 
use packages and create all object under the model. Not really 
acceptable.

The bug is already fixed for the next version (SP05) and we need the QTS 
for porting the fix to a PL for a previous version (SP04 or SP03?)
This part is handled/decided by the sustaining team.

Best regards

Laurent

1. Custom form "Replace Database Connection tab" not work
   To reproduce:In any dmm extension, add a custom form for DMM database 
object, and choose the Type option "Replace Database Connection tab". 
Open the DMM database, the original database connection tab doesnot be 
replaced with the new form. (See attachment figure 1)
2. If default value of extended attribute is specified as "Template", it 
does not work.
   To reproduce: In any dmm extension, add an extended attribute such as 
"DatabaseTypeVersion" on DMM database object and add "Default value" as 
template "%getDefaultTypeVersion%". Specify any string such as "abc" on 
the template %getDefaultTypeVersion%. Open "Extended Attributes" tab of 
database object, you will see 
the default value of it is %getDefaultTypeVersion% not the template 
content.

Description :                                       
	 In Microsoft SQL Server, you can have two tables of the same name 
as long as they are in different schemas.
While reversing a database schema into an existing Physical Data Model, 
PowerDesigner considers the two tables are the same and the updated model 
does not reflect the database schema anymore.
Examples of errors that may be returned during reverse:
 - Column colname (colname): A primary column must be mandatory.
 - An index linked to a key must be unique.

Note: Customer has requested a solution for VBS too.
PD API usage is required to be fixed. In this case, reverse engineering 
process is automated via PD API.


Repro steps:
1. Create the following SQL script and save it:
create schema SCHEMA1
go

create table Schema1.T1 (
   C1    char(10)   null
)
go
2. Create a new PDM that targets Microsoft SQL Server 2012.
3. Create a schema SCHEMA2.
3. Create a table T1 having a primary column C1, and assign SCHEMA2 to 
T1.
4. Create this SQL script  and save it.
5. Select Database > Update Model from Database, select Using script 
files and add the above SQL file.
6. Click OK.
The Merge Models displays:
- Create Schema "SCHEMA1" in the Physical Data Model
- Modify Column "C1" in the Table "T1" (Data Type, Mandatory)
- Modify Table "T1" in the Physical Data Model (Owner, Primary Key)
- Modify Physical Data Model (Model Options)
7. Click OK
Error: Column 'C1' (C1): A primary column must me mandatory.

Check in bug model Vertical.bpm in bug directory.
Open and edit diagram 'Vertical BPD' in portal.
Click 'Change Pool to Horizontal' in Tools menu.
Draw a new Pool on diagram, and the new pool is horizontal.
Save and submit the change, then pool in changelist is still horizontal.
Publish the changelist, then open diagram 'Vertical BPD - v2' again. But 
pool comes back to a vertical one. (see Vertical - v2.bpm in bug

Diagram: sub-objects with Display uncheck remain displayed on symbol

In migrated models, sub-objects with the Display property uncheck remain 
visible on the symbol in the diagram. In a new PD 16.5.x model, this 
issue is not reproduced.

To reproduce:
1) open project.ldm
2) open properties of any entity
3) uncheck the Display property on several entity attributes
4) click OK
NOTE: all attributes are still listed on the symbol.

If you check the sub-object format, the uncheck attributes are not listed

It seems that the problem occurred since name to code conversion. 
Steps:
 - Check in bug model in bug model directory to Library folder.
 - Open and edit its diagram in portal.
 - Draw a new task and type character 'Send', and select 'Send Appt' 
(could be any one here) in auto completion list.
 - This new created object should be replaced by selected object. But a 
Task with selected name is created.

Import bpmn file in bug directory.
But some flow symbols are not correctly imported, they only have middle 
pints (see pic in bug directory). 

This bpmn2 file is exported from NetWeaver, so only middle points of flow 
are exported as waypoints of BPMNEdge, anchor points are not included. 
BPMNEdge that have waypoints are not well imported.

	 *** Tue Jul 15 11:06:20 UTC+0200 2014 *** vaudino ***
Since we are compiling PDWeb in release mode, we have noticed that 
browsers are "caching" a lot of things, including scripts.
When we deploy new version of PD Web, sometimes cache of client browser 
cab contains wrong script and this can result in strange unreproductible 
errors.

Workaround is to clean the brower cache.

We should research a way to properly identify scripts for browsers to 
force them to reload scritps if version is different.

1. Check in the attached bug model.
2. Open ReusableTasks diagram, switch to edit mode.
3. Move Task_2 which Reusable process property was set to true into 
SubProcess_1.

Results:
Reusable should be set to false after task moved into subprocess instead 
of keeping its value as true.

Import bpmn2 file in bug directory, and then save.
But in context pad of 'Normal Gateway', you can change it to 'Normal 
Gateway'.
Check out saved model in PD fat client (gateway.bpm in bug directory), 
stereotype of 'Normal Gateway' is 'Stereotype'.  

Corresponding symbol of exclusiveGateway 'Exclusive Gateway' has a 
property 'IsMarkerVisible=true', so it is imported as Exclusive Gateway.
Corresponding symbol of exclusiveGateway 'Normal Gateway' has no property 
'IsMarkerVisible' (which means its value is false), so it should be 
imported as Normal Gateway. But it is imported as a gateway without 
stereotype.

In portal import bpmn2 file in bug directory, then save.
But in PD fat client, check out the result model (SubPorcess.bpm in bug 
directory), symbols of tasks and sub-processes are set to auto adjust to

Should not, since symbol size is imported from bpmn2 file.

There is a flow linking two tasks. Change Task_1 to Sub-Process, change

Then try to select flow symbol, but it is difficult. Even it is selected,

Check in library.bpm to Library and build index.
Open model test.bpm and edit diagram.
Sub-process has sub symbols. Edit Sub-process name in place, input 
character 'proc' and select one term in auto complete list. Then sub-
process is replaced by shortcut. But its sub symbols are still there.
Save change. Go to workspace and open diagram in changelist. But sub 
symbols has no name and no properties.
If parent object is deleted, should also delete sub-objects and their 
symbols.

Description :                                           
	 If a view uses * and if the underlying tables change e.g., adding, 
altering or deleting columns, PowerDesigner should not only generate an 
ALTER TABLE statement to modify the table but also recreate the view.

Repro steps:
1. In a PDM, create a table T1 having columns C1 and C2.
2. Create and edit a view, click the SQL Query and set the query:
select * from T1
3. Archive the model.
4. Add another column C3 to T1.
5. Select Database > Apply Model Changes to Database, use the archive 
model to get the schema and click OK.
The Database Synchronization dialog shows it will add C3 to T1, and view 
SQL query does not change and remains select * from T1.
Generated SQL is:
alter table T1 add C3 CHAR(10);

6. Reverse View_1 and edit reversed object
SQL query is :
select C1, C2 from T1.

Use bug model.
Sub-process has child objects, but its symbol is in none-composite view.
Open diagram on portal, its child objects are also displayed, but no 
inside of sub-process rectangle (see pic in bug directory).

Label  : model still read-only after the creation from a read-only 
template

from Sylva Paulo

If you are using as a template directory, a library diretory on which 
user only have read-only permission, when you create a model from a 
template the model is created read-only.
Workaround is to close it (you have the save question), save it, close it 
and then open it again to start modeling on it.

<<
I am working with a customer who wants to push model templates to users 
using the repository. 
As you may know it is recommended that almost all users most have read 
permission to the library folder except for the library administrators.
Well, what happens is: since the “regular” users have read permissions on 
the template models when they try to create a new model from those 
templates these new models are created as read-only.
I configured PD to get the templates from the Library´s local directory 
so that the user “always” create new models via the new model windows > 
templates.
Even creating models from templates through the new model windows, these 
new models are created as read-only. To have the model editable I need to 
create it, save it, close it and then open it again to start modeling on 
it.

Comment header must be ordered by date of last reply, more recent ones 
first
Inside a conversation, message are ordered by creation date, last ones 
first.

Les contraintes de design des commentaires sont :
-	Les réponses sont en dessous des commentaires.
-	Un commentaire nouvellement créé s’affiche en premier.
-	Les réponses aux réponses ne sont pas différenciées des réponses 
aux commentaires. 

Donc : 
-	Le classement s’effectue d’abord par conversation (bloc de 
commentaire+ses réponses). On classe ces conversation par ordre 
décroissant de la dernière date de son commentaires et ses réponses.
-	On classe ensuite à l’intérieur de la conversation par ordre 
croissant du commentaire ou de la réponse (ou réponse de réponse)

SAP Jam fait cela quand l’input field de commentaire est en tête de liste 
:  La dernière réponse à un commentaire  fait remonter le commentaire en 
tête de liste.
  Par exemple https://jam4.sapjam.com/profile/wall/5BogbAge2gVEp9t9JptPPW 

Plus mathématiquement :

Soit les commentaires Cx et les réponses CxRy dans l’ordre temporel 
croissant de création : C1, C2, C3, C1R4, C5
L’ordre affiché sera
C5
C1
  C1R4
C2

PD should be able to revese RANDOM index from DB2 Version 10 z/Os

*Observed Behaviour
Ct is unable to reverse random index from DB.
If using script file the index get the expression "COLUMN_1 RANDOM" and 
is ascending in the 

Steps to reproduce:

Reverse table -> 

create table TABLE_1 (
   COLUMN_1             CHAR(10),
   COLUMN_2             CHAR(10),
   COLUMN_3             CHAR(10)
);

--==============================================================
-- Index: INDEX_1
--==============================================================
create index INDEX_1 on TABLE_1 (
   COLUMN_1             RANDOM
);


Or create a table with RANDOM sorting and reverse from live DB

Label  : CDM/LDM - PDM generation: PK key and index should have cluster 
option 
	 selected
Description :

Target DBMS: MS SQL Server family

In a PDM when you create a PK, the key is created with the 'cluster' 
selected by default. (This correctly matches the MS SQL Server defaults.)

When generating from a CDM/LDM, the PK key and index are created as 'non 
clustered' by default. 

The customer states that during the generation process, PD should be 
aware that MS SQL server is the target DBMS and therefore generate the PK 
and PK index according to SQL Server defaults. 

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create an LDM
2. Create an Entity 
3. Create an Attribute and mark it as primary
4. Generate Physical Data Model
5. A PK key and index are created in the PDM but are not clustered.

Customer believes this is a bug since Primary Keys are Clustered Indexes 
in MS SQL Server.

Customer has an XMI file that was generated by MagicDraw.  When 
attempting to import the file, an unexpected exception occurs and the 
import process stops.

NOTE; same results in v15.3 except the error message is not generated.

	 The XMI 2.1 file generated from Rational Software Modeler requires 
an external xml file that contains information about predefined data 
types and stereotypes (among other elements). PD fails to identify the 
data type and assigns it to DefaultDataType int.

XMI from Rational:
