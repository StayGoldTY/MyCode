<h1>Release Notes for SAP[R] PowerDesigner[R] Version 16.5 SP05</h1>

<p>© 2015 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company. All rights reserved.
<p>Updated March  27th, 2015

<p>Thank you for choosing PowerDesigner as your design tool!  
<br>Please read this document to learn about last minute updates to the product and documentation.
<br> 
<br> 
<br>This version is certified for the following 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems:
<br>Windows Server 2008
<br>Windows Server 2012
<br>Windows 7
<br>Windows 8
<br>Windows 8.1
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<!-- Added for Beta 
PowerDesigner 16.5 Beta will run until end of January 2013.
-->
<!-- removed for beta -->
<p>Even if you have purchased only some of the PowerDesigner modules, you can install the others in stand-alone mode for a 15 days evaluation period.
<!-- -->
<p>Non-administrator users may receive a warning message during installation. Setup requires write access on certain directories and on the registry that non-administrator users may not have. Setup can continue despite this warning message but will fail if the user does not have the required rights.
<br>
<!-- removed for beta -->
<br>PowerDesigner supports the SAP Asset Management (SYSAM) system used by some other SAP products, which provides various forms of license. You can install PowerDesigner in trial mode, or with a served license (requires a license server) or an unserved local license. In served mode (and stand-alone seat served - legacy mode), be sure to indicate both server name and port. Even if optional, it is better to indicate the port number, for which the default value is 27000.
<br>
<br>PowerDesigner 16.5 cannot use the same license file as PowerDesigner 16.1. Please contact your sales representative.
<br>
<!-- -->
<!-- Added for Beta
<br>PowerDesigner 16.5 Beta cannot be used through terminal services (remote desktop).
-->



<h2>Installation alongside previous versions of PowerDesigner</h2>
PowerDesigner 16.5 SP05 will not update any instance of PowerDesigner 15.x<br>
PowerDesigner 16.5 SP05 will update any instance of PowerDesigner 16.5, 16.1 or 16.0<br>

PowerDesigner 16.5 SP05 and PowerDesigner 15.x (and lower) can coexist on the same computer without any major problems, but you should not install PowerDesigner 16.5 in the same directory as PowerDesigner 15.x.
<br><br>Though v15.x and v16.x can be installed together on the same workstation, after the installation of v16.x, the add-ins importing from Visio and Word will only function for v16.x.
<br>In the same way, the Eclipse plug-in will only work for v16.x.
<br><br>A Sysam license server can serve licenses for both PowerDesigner 15 and PowerDesigner 16 except for the Data Architect package.
<br>The PowerDesigner install launcher run from the DVD only provides access to the 32-bit Sysam install. You can find the Sysam 64-bit install on the DVD in the Sysam-2_3 directory.
<br>We recommend that you upgrade the Sysam License server to the most recent version. You can download it from <A Href= "https://support.sap.com/software/installations.html">SAP Support Portal</A>. Click on Installations and Upgrades, then "A-Z Index" and then "S". Click on SYSAM and then SySAM 2.3.
<br>
<br>Even if you upgrade from a previous PowerDesigner 16.5 version, you must regenerate your license file.
<!-- added for beta 
<br><br>If possible we recommend that you do not install PowerDesigner 16.5 Beta on same computer as previous PowerDesigner version.<br>
-->
<!--
<br><br>Before installing PowerDesigner 16.5 you must uninstall PowerDesigner 16.5 Beta.
<br>Before installing PowerDesigner Proxy 16.5 you must uninstall PowerDesigner Proxy 16.5 Beta.
<br>Before installing PowerDesigner Portal 16.5 you must uninstall PowerDesigner Portal 16.5 Beta.
 -->

<!-- added for beta 
PowerDesigner 16.5 Beta cannot cohabit with PowerDesigner 16.x. PowerDesigner 16.5 Beta will automatically update a PowerDesigner 16.x installation. It must be installed on a computer that does not already have a PowerDesigner 16.x installed.
<p>You must not update a 15.x or 16.x production repository with PowerDesigner 16.5 Beta.
-->

<br>

<p>The first time you open a v16.5 SP04 or lower model or extract a model from a newly upgraded repository, it will be updated to v16.5 SP05. This process takes longer than the standard time needed to open a model saved with v16.5 SP05.</p>
<p>Models saved with v16.5 SP05 may be corrupted if they are opened in v16.5 SP04 or lower.
<br>
<br>PowerDesigner requires the Microsoft .NET framework v4.0 or higher. If the framework is not already available on your machine, then the set up will install the initial v4.0 framework. After installation is complete, we recommend that you check for and install the latest <A  HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/search/DownloadResults.aspx?q=Microsoft%20.NET%20Framework">security updates</A>.
<br><br>PowerDesigner and PowerDesigner Viewer should not be installed on the same computer.

</ul>

For more information, refer to the New Features Summary in online documentation.

<h2>Database and Language support</h2>
<ul>
<!-- removed for beta -->
New features require an auto-fix of targets saved with versions before 16.5.
<br>For better performance, we recommend that you re-save your own language and DBMS definition files and extensions with PowerDesigner 16.5.   
<br><br>
<!--  -->

<li><strong>Modified Database Definition files between 16.5 SP04 and 16.5 SP05</strong>
<br>The following database definition files have been modified.
<ul>
	<li>Hadoop Hive 1.0
	<li>IBM DB2 Version 10.x for Linux, UNIX, and Windows
	<li>IBM DB2 Version 10 for z/OS
	<li>Microsoft SQL Server 2005

</ul>
<!-- removed for beta -->
<br>The following DBMS versions are newly supported:
<ul>
	<li>Netezza 7.x
	<li>IBM DB2 Version 11 for z/OS

</ul>
<!--
<br>The following DBMS versions are deprecated in this version:
<ul>
  <li>PostgreSQL 7.3
  <li>Microsoft SQL Server 2000
  <li>Sybase AS Enterprise 15.0
  <li>Sybase SQL Anywhere 10
  <li>Sybase IQ 15.0 - 15.1
</ul>

<br>The following (previously deprecated) DBMS versions have been moved to the deprecated folder inside the DBMS directory:
<ul>	
  <li>IBM DB2 UDB 8.x Common Server (Deprecated)
  <li>IBM DB2 UDB 8 for OS/390 (Deprecated)
  <li>Sybase IQ 12.7 (Deprecated)
  <li>Microsoft Access 2000 (Deprecated)
  <li>Teradata V2R6 (Deprecated)
</ul>
-->


<br>
<!--
<br>The Logical database definition file has been removed, and is replaced by the new Logical Data Model module.
<br>PowerDesigner v12.5 (and older) PDMs targeting the Logical DBMS will be transformed into an LDM when you open them in v15.0 and higher.
<br>If you want to continue to use a physical data model for LDM modeling, you can target the ANSI DBMS, or copy the Logical DBMS provided with version 12.5 to the 15 DBMS resource files directory to reuse it.
<br><br>
-->


<li><strong>Customized DBMS and resources</strong>
<br>DBMS and language definition files and other resource files provided with PowerDesigner are constantly evolving. If you have not edited the resource files delivered with a previous version of PowerDesigner, then the upgrade to the latest version will happen silently.
<br>If you have edited a definition file or other resource file from a previous version, then it will continue to work with the new version. However, we advise you to use the Compare tool to review the differences between your file and the file delivered with the new version and, if appropriate, merge them to obtain bug fixes or new features. For information about comparing and merging resource files, see Customizing and Extending PowerDesigner > Working with PowerDesigner Resource Files. If you have stored resource files from a previous version in the repository then you must check them in again under the new version before you can continue to use them.
<br><br>
<br>The PowerDesigner "3-way merge" can help you performing the merge properly.
<br><br>You will need to have the three XDB versions involved to perform the merge and to prepare the target file to be generated from the merge:
<ul><li><b>&lt;Base&gt;</b>: The initial standard version provided by PowerDesigner that you have modified to create &lt;Yours&gt;. You should copy the original XDB before upgrading PowerDesigner in order to save it. If you no longer have access to the base version of the XDB, you can reinstall the previous version or ask technical support to provide you with the file.
<br>eg: <b>"C:\PD\v1650\dbms\us\db2mvs9.xdb"</b>
<li><b>&lt;Yours&gt;</b>: The version modified by you.
	<br>eg: <b>"C:\PD\v1650\dbms\us\db2mvs9_modified.xdb"</b>
<li><b>&lt;Theirs&gt;</b>: The new standard version provided with the new upgrade version of PowerDesigner.
<br>eg: <b>"C:\PD\v1652\dbms\us\db2mvs9.xdb"</b>
<li><b>&lt;Merged&gt;</b>: The target file to be output by the 3-way merge. Copy the &lt;Theirs&gt; version here to initialize it.
<br>eg: <b>"C:\PD\v1652\dbms\us\db2mvs9_modified.xdb"</b>
</ul>
<br>You launch the 3-way merge from the command line
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pdshell16.exe  -do:MergeTarget &lt;Base&gt; &lt;Yours&gt; &lt;Theirs&gt; &lt;Merged&gt;</b>
<br><br>&lt;Yours&gt; and &lt;Merged&gt; should be writable
<br>Example:
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pdshell16.exe  -do:MergeTarget "C:\PD\v1650\dbms\us\db2mvs9.xdb" "C:\PD\v1650\dbms\us\db2mvs9_modified.xdb" "C:\PD\v1652\dbms\us\db2mvs9.xdb" "C:\PD\v1652\dbms\us\db2mvs9_modified.xdb"</b>

<br><br>The PowerDesigner merge dialog will show the differences between the 3 versions provided, allowing you to review them and resolve any conflicts.
<BR><br>

<li><strong>Connection to a database with ANSI charset</strong>
<br>The PowerDesigner repository may need to store characters outside the basic ANSI character list.
<vr>If the charset of your repository database is not at least a superset of the ISO-15 character list, repository creation or update will fail.
<br>Be sure to have a repository database charset which is at least a superset of the ISO-15 character list.
<BR>Alternatively you can set the "Bytes per char" option of the repository definition to 2.<br><br>

<li><strong>Connection to a Unicode database</strong>
<br>For some databases, you may have to set up charset information in the ODBC drivers dialog when you connect to a Unicode database.
<br>Depending on the character set that the target database uses, you may have to change the charset attribute of your ODBC data source.
<BR>For example, to connect to a Unicode Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise database, you must indicate in the charset field the code of the Unicode character set (in this case "utf8").
<br>Each ODBC driver has its own tuning parameters to indicate the character set. This information is located in the driver help file. Search for the keywords "charset" or "character set" in the ODBC driver help file.
<br><br>

<li><strong>"Not Certified" resource files</strong>
<br>Some resource files are delivered with "Not Certified" in their names. 
<br>We will perform all possible validation checks, but we do not maintain specific environments to fully certify these resource files. We will support them by accepting bug reports and providing fixes as per standard policy, with the exception that there will be no final environmental validation of the fix. You are invited to assist us by testing fixes and reporting any continuing inconsistencies.
<br><br>

<br><br>
-->
</ul>

<h2>Additional information and known issues</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>PowerDesigner Web Remarks</strong>
	<ul><br>
	<li><strong>Charset of JVM of the application server hosting PDWeb application</strong>
	<br>If you are installing PowerDesigner to another application server than that delivered with the setup, make sure you set the default charset of the JVM to UTF-8.
	<br>You must set the file.encoding property when running the VM. Refer to  this <A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/361975/setting-the-default-java-character-encoding">StackOverflow</A> topic.
    <br><br>
	<li><strong>LDAP SSL connection is only working with Active Directory type.</strong>
    <br><br>
	<li><strong>Database upgrade</strong>
	<li>We recommend that you stop the PowerDesigner Web server service during database update by PowerDesigner desktop.
	<br><br>
	<li><strong>Moving from PowerDesigner Web 16.5 SP04 to SP05</Strong>
	<br>In order to properly see and update business process models and process maps, we recommend to upgrade models in the repository, via a check-in.
	<br><br>
	<li><strong>Cache</strong>
	If a user is experiencing problems following upgrading the PowerDesigner Web server, we recommend that you exclude the possibility of a caching issue by instructing them to empty their browser cache:
	Internet Explorer: Tools>Internet Options>General>Browsing history>Delete Temporary Internet files and website files.
	Firefox: Tools>Options>Advanced>Network>Cached Web Content>Clear Now.
	Chrome: History>Clear Browsing Data>Cached Images and Files.
	Safari: Preferences>Advanced>Show Develop menu in menu bar. Then select Develop>Empty Caches.
	Mobile Safari: Settings>Safari>Clear History and Website Data.
	<br><bR>
	<li><Strong>Multibyte character setting for Portal</strong>
	<br>In case your repository is not unicode and you are manipulating multibyte character strings, you have to set the Bytes per char option of your repository definition to 2 or 3 in the PowerDesigner desktop client along with the maxBytesPerChar option in the Portal settings.
	<br>Edit repository.xml and set the maxBytesPerChar parameter to 2 or 3.
	<br>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;param name="maxBytesPerChar" value="3"/>
	<br>
	<br>The default value of this parameter is 1.
	<br><br>
	<LI><strong>Portal setup and connection test</strong>
	<BR>During Web Portal setup, you can define and test your database connection. If you have no JRE installed on the computer, this test requires a Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package that you can download from Microsoft download center for <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555" >x86</A> and <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=14632">x64</A> platforms.
	<br><BR>


	</ul>

	
<li><B>PowerDesigner Desktop</B>
	<br><br>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Language used multiple times</strong>
	<br>Documentation advises not to copy languages file but use provided copy function. In case the path used to search languages contains several files with the same internal ID, only the first one will be presented to the user when he selects a language.
	<br><br>
	

<li><strong>Why cant I access my PowerDesigner SAP integration features?</strong>
<br>
If you have upgraded from v16.5 SP02 or earlier, and your license entitles you to SAP platform integration features, you should regenerate
your PowerDesigner license keys at SAP Service Marketplace (SMP) at http://service.sap.com/licensekeys to ensure that you have access to new features in this version.
<br><br>

<li><strong>BPMN Name Change</strong>
<br>Due to the new support of "BPMN 2.0 Descriptive", the existing "BPMN 2.0" language delivered in PD 16.5 SP02 has been renamed to BPMN 2.0 Executable.
<br><br>

 
<LI><strong>Microsoft Office 2007 limitation</strong>
<br>If you are using Office 2007, you must install Office 2007 SP3 in order to be able to use the Requirement Model Word add-in. See the <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3770">Microsoft download page.</a>
<br><br>

<LI><strong>Solution Manager prerequisites</strong>
<br>In order to use the Solution Manager import and export, you should first :
<ul>
<li>Read and follow documentation « How to Configure SAP Solution Manager 7.1 for Business Process Blueprinting.pdf.
<li>Test your configuration with Business BluePrint (host, port, user, password, context ID).
</ul>
<br>
<li><Strong>Microsoft Visual Studio Support</Strong>
<br>
PowerDesigner Microsoft Visual Studio add-in is no longer delivered since PowerDesigner v16.5 SP02.
<br>

<br>
<li><strong>New Report Interface</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Report Design Surface and Outline Views</strong>
<br>When you click on an item in the Outline view, synchronization of the Design view may take several seconds the first time.
<br><br>
<li><strong>RTF report template</strong>
<br>The change that was required for the RTF report template in order to properly generate titles with the new report is no longer necessary and can be removed from your template.
<br>If you are using customized templates, you should modify them to remove the title paragraph reference added at the end of the report template.
<br><br>

<li><strong>Limitations compared to 16.1</strong>
<ul>
<li>New report does not have global selection. You should use item selection instead.
<li>There is no multiple selection of items in the Outline view or Toolbox. 
<li>In a MMR, there is only one header and footer instead of one per section.
<!-- <li>Conversion of old reports does not import styles. Use the following registry key to copy styles to each new report item as an individual format (rather than a global style). 
HKEY_CURRENT_MACHINE\Software\Sybase\PowerDesigner 16\General
ImportReportFormat = Yes-->
<li>You can no longer list only those extended attributes that are modified.
<li>The test data profile card is not maintained as in 16.1. You can create three books with filters.
<li>You cannot launch the report wizard from inside a report to configure a section.
<li>You cannot see report content in a model merge when a difference is detected.
<li>The new report interface is not supported under Eclipse.
<li>There is no help when entering variables in the report header and footer. Refer to documentation to get the variable list.
<!-- <li>You cannot rename a report template once created. -->
<!-- <li>You cannot create a template from a report that does not have section. -->
<li>There is no contextual help for the new editor.
<br><br>
</ul>
</uL>
<li><strong>XSM Full Shortcut</strong>
<br>PowerDesigner now supports using full shortcuts in the XSM module. By default the "External Shortcut Properties" option will be set to "Name/code". If you want to use the full shortcut option, you must set the XSM  "External Shortcut Properties" model option to "All". In order to use full shortcuts in a new XSM model use the "Set as default" button to save this default to the registry.
<br><br>
<li><strong>Branches</strong>
<br>Repository branches were re-engineered in 16.1:
<ul>
<li>You can simultaneously display all branches in the repository browser. 
	<li>You can branch the contents of any folder in the repository. Branch names must be unique for the folder, but may be reused in another folder. 
<li>You can use permissions to control access to individual branches and integrate changes made in one branch into another. 
<li>Modifications made to one branch are not visible to others, and documents added to a parent branch are not visible to child branches, unless you integrate the change.
<li>The version numbers are simplified and start with 1 on each branch.
</ul>
<br>The transition to the new branch system from a pre-16.1 version requires deep changes in the repository structure and contents. Consequently, the repository upgrade may take several hours (depending on the number of branches and documents in your repository). We advise you to run the upgrade at night or over a weekend. No hourglass is visible to indicate progress during the upgrade, but the output pane does display information about the work that the upgrade is doing.

<br><br>As an example, for a database with the following characteristics, the upgrade may take 6 hours if you select the option that copies only those documents that were specifically checked into the old branch to the upgraded branch:
<br>* 3 million lines in PMOBJT 
<br>* 9 million lines in PMRLSH 
<br>* 40 branches
<br>* 200 000 objects modified per branch
<br>
<br>If your repository contains more than 20 branches we strongly advise you to select the option that does not copy all models to all branches.
<br><br>For documentation about the new branches, see Core Features Guide > Storing, Sharing, and Reporting on Models > The Repository > Branching Version Trees
<br><br>
<li><strong>Resource File Paths</strong>
<!-- 
<br>If you have not changed the default paths to resource files then they are updated to point to the new install path (even if the "Keep PowerDesigner version settings" option is selected in the installer) in order to obtain bug fixes and improvements delivered with this version. If you have changed one or more of the default paths (for example, to make them point to a folder outside the PowerDesigner installation directory in order to develop your own resource files), then your custom paths will be retained, but you will not benefit from the new bug fixes and improvements.
-->
<br>From v16.1, PowerDesigner supports multiple paths for resource files enabling you to populate your resource file lists with the standard files delivered with the install and with one or more folders of your custom resource files. We recommend that you take advantage of this new capability to:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Copy your custom resource files to a suitable path outside the PowerDesigner installation directory.
<li>Ensure that this path and the default path (inside \install_dir\Resource Files) are present in the list of paths in the resource file list (see the Path tool in Core Features Guide > The PowerDesigner Interface > Customizing Your Modeling Environment > PowerDesigner Resource Files and also the Virtualization section below).
</ul>
<br>
<li><strong>Repository Optimisation: Increase PMTEXT size</strong>
<br>PowerDesigner cuts blocks of text into pieces to save them in the PMTEXT table. The size of the TDAT column controls the size of these pieces and thus influences the number of pieces created for each block of text and the speed of PowerDesigner manipulating text during check-in / check-out.
<br>
<br>If the size of the TDAT column is too small, PowerDesigner may be slowed down when reading and writing text. If PD has not created the TDAT column with the maximum size authorized by the database, you can increase it by hand by changing the line with NAME = "MaxTextSize" in PMOPTS and altering the PMTEXT table.
<br>
<br>To increase the size of text pieces, for example to 4000 bytes, run the following SQL:
<br>
<p class=code>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alter table PMTEXT modify TDAT varchar(4000) null;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;update PMOPTS set VALE='4000' where NAME='MaxTextSize';
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commit;
</p>

<!--
<li><strong>Edit description in Portal</strong>
<br>PowerDesigner Portal now supports editing object descriptions and annotations directly in your Web browser, including modifying text, fonts, and tables and uploading images.
<br>Supported image formats are BMP, JPEG, PNG, and non-animated GIF.
<br>TIF and vector image (WMF, EMF, copy of PD symbol) are not supported
<br>Supported fonts are Arial, Comic Sans MS, Courier New, Tahoma, Times New Roman, Verdana. Other non supported fonts are preserved.
<br>Copy/paste in the Portal text area does not support copying tables, images and fonts.

<li><strong>Change in Auto-Connect Feature</strong>
<br>In PowerDesigner 16.0 and earlier, the Auto-connect option silently connected the user to the last-accessed repository.
<br>To enhance security, PowerDesigner no longer saves user passwords, and the auto-connect option will trigger a repository connection dialog when PowerDesigner is launched.
<br>In the same way, PowerDesigner no longer allows empty passwords, 
<br><br>
<li><strong>Automatic Link Routing and Intersection Bridges</strong>
<br>Automatic link routing is not available on free curve or free angle corners, CDM association links, or any links in EAM organization charts, BPM process hierarchy diagrams, and XSM XML diagrams.
<br>The Show bridges option is not available on link symbols with free curve corners or CDM association links, OOM sequence diagrams and XSM XML diagrams.
<br><br>

<li><strong>64-bit Support</strong>
<br>PowerDesigner is now available in both 32-bit version and 64-bit versions.
<br>To ensure that PowerDesigner can communicate with your data sources, you should use the corresponding version of the ODBC Administrator tool. For detailed information about working with 32-bit DSNs on a 64-bit version of
Windows, see <A Href=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942976>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942976.</A>
<br>As an exception, if you use an ODBC connection with the SAP BusinessObject Universe generation, you will have to define a 32-bit ODBC data source, whatever the PowerDesigner version.
<br><br>

<li><strong>PowerDesigner 16 and PowerBuilder</strong>
<br>PowerDesigner can no longer be used as a PowerBuilder plugin.
<br><br>

<li><strong>Changes in Metamodel and API in 16.5</Strong>
<br>
<ul>
<!-- <li>Display name in browser modifiable -->
<!-- <li>New event handlers? -->
<li>New comparison helper
<br>This helper class provides advanced features for the comparison of two models or two resources.
It can be created and initialized by calling the CreateComparisonHelper() method on a model or on a resource object like an extended model definition or a DBMS.
<br>Refer to ComparisonHelper class
<br>
<li>Cube metamodel change
<br>In 16.1 physical models, the Cube and Fact objects were very similar and contained nearly the same information.
<br>In 16.5, the Cube object has been merged with the Fact object.
<br>During opening of a 16.1 model, cubes and facts will be merged and associations of the cube will be moved to the fact.
The comment, description, and annotation of the cube will be lost.
The cube item will be removed from reports. You can replace potentially missing report information such as "List of cube associations" and "Cube select" with items available under the Fact in the report Toolbox.
<br><BR>
</ul>
<li><strong>Changes in Metamodel and API in 16.1</Strong>
<ul>
<li>Branch change - the following attributes have been removed:
<br>* RepositoryConnection.CurrentBranchName
<li>Password change - the following attributes have been removed:
<br>* BasePhysicalModelOptions.Password
<br>* BasePhysicalModelOptions.SavePassword
</ul>
<br>
<li><strong>Changes in metamodel and API in 16.0</Strong>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Function "MergeInto"
<li>Extended attribute of float type and locale support.
<br>Display of decimal attributes now respects regional settings.
<br>For extended attributes, the value is saved with US settings but is displayed according to the computer's settings. For example a float extended attribute with a value of "1234567" is displayed as  "1,234,567" on a US machine and as "1 234 567" on a French machine.
<br>The API methods that access extended attribute values have been changed accordingly
<br>
<br>in VBS
<br>GetExtendedAttribute - returns the number (in a string: "1234567" )
<br>GetExtendedAttributeText - returns the text with regional settings formatting in a string (eg (in US): "1,234,567")
<br>
<br>SetExtendedAttribute - inputs a number
<br>SetExtendedAttributeText - inputs text with regional settings formatting
<br>
<br>On custom forms:
<br>Set - inputs string in current locale
<br>Get - gets string in current locale
<br><br>
<li>Method Rtf2Html
<br>A new method is available on the PowerDesigner application object that will allow you to transform RTF into HTML text:
<br>Rtf2Html(rtf As String) As String

<!-- remark from previous release
<li><Strong>Change in user-defined type representation for Microsoft SQLServer</Strong>
<br>In PowerDesigner 12.5 and before, Abstract Data Types could be used to generate aliases to basic types or CLR types. They can now only be used to create CLR types, and aliases must be created using Domains.
<br><br>
<li><Strong>Checking out 12.5 logical model from repository</strong>
<br>The checking-out of Logical 12.5 PDM will no longer convert the PDM into LDM. The conversion is now done during the first opening after checkout.

<!--
<li><strong>Opening Oracle PDM models containing views from pre-12.0 version</Strong>
<br>Related to CR #449810.
<br>This bug was caused by the mismatch between views and Oracle packages during 
the reverse engineering by script.
In previous versions, the Usage attribute was always set to "query only" 
(Read-Only) by PowerDesigner, no matter the usage of the view in Oracle. It will be now generated according to the Oracle syntax.
<br>We have added an auto-update of the model when opening it so that only views containing the "with read only" syntax in the query are actually kept read-only. All others have this attribute reset and by default will be updateable.
Views with the Usage attribute set to "With check options" are not affected by the auto-
update.
<br>In the event that the "query only" flag must be kept, even if SQL Order means the opposite, you must run the following VBS on the model before opening the model with version 12.5. This VBS adds the read-only syntax on the view sql query if it is not set and the view usage attribute is set to "Query only" (not recommended.)
<br>
<br><<
<br>' This VBScript browse all views from model and
<br>' updates the sql query to match the "query only" attribute of the view
<br>UpdateViewQuery ActiveModel
<br>
<br>Sub UpdateViewQuery(pPackg)

<br>         s = replace(s, vbTab, "")
<br>         s = replace(s, vbLf, "")
<br>         s = replace(s, vbCr, "")
<br>         s = replace(s, " ", "")
<br>         if (Right(lcase(s), Len("WithReadOnly")) <> "withreadonly") then

<li><strong>Reverse engineering of Where clause from Replication Server in the Information Liquidity Model</strong>
<br>For Replication Server 12.5 or 12.6, the reverse engineering of article and subscription "where" clauses can be incomplete if the columns involved in these clauses have the following data types (the result is different depending on whether RSSD is deployed on an ASA or ASE server):
<br>ASA RSSD:
<ul><li>smallmoney
<li>datetime
<li>date
<li>time
<li>smalldatetime
<li>numeric
<li>decimal
<li>float</ul>
<br>ASE RSSD:

<li><strong>DBMS-Specific Physical Options tab in Physical Data Model</strong>
<br>In some cases, the DBMS-specific tab for physical options in the PDM will not show all possible physical options. If you need to use one of the missing options, you must use the standard Physical Options tab.
<br><br>

<!--
<li><strong>Repository on MBCS or Unicode database</strong>
<br>When you are connecting to a Unicode or MBCS database and consolidating models with MBCS data, you must have a specific registry key setup in order to properly take into account the size of each character in the database. 
<br>The "MaxBytesPerChar" value indicates the number of bytes used to save a character in the database.  
<br>This entry is automatically installed during setup if your code page is different from Latin Western characters (ie cp1250, cp1252 or cp1254). If this is not the case, but you want to connect to a Unicode or MBCS database to save MBCS data, you will need to set this key manually.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Sybase\PowerDesigner 15\Repository]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"MaxBytesPerChar"="3" 
<br>The MaxBytesPerChar value depends on the database charset:
<ul><li>For SBCS (Single Byte Character Set), you do not need the registry key or you can set its value to "1"
<li>For DBCS (Double Byte Character Set), you must set the registry key value to "2"
<li>For Unicode (or MBCS, ie. Multiple Byte Character Set), you must set the registry key value to "3" (or more, in rare cases)</ul>
<br><br>
-->

<li><strong>Repository on SQL Server</strong>
<br>When creating a repository on SQL Server, you should avoid using dbo as table owner. Create a specific user to be the owner of PowerDesigner repository tables.
<br><br>

<li><strong>Issues with ASE ODBC Driver and PowerDesigner Repository</strong>
<br>When using an ASE database for the PowerDesigner repository with an ASE ODBC driver, you must select the "Enable Dynamic Prepare" option on the "Connection" tab.
<br><br>When using an ASE 15 database for the PowerDesigner repository with an ASE ODBC driver, documents consolidated will be extracted and truncated per package of 32k each section of 1 MB.
<br>For example:
<ul>
<li>PT (1 165 KB); size after extraction = 64 KB 
<li>JPG (305 KB); size after extraction = 32 KB 
<li>DOC. (2 803 KB); size after extraction = 96 KB 
<li>PDF (4 695 KB); size after extraction = 160 KB 
<li>ZIP (6 574 KB); size after extraction = 224 KB 
<li>PDF (13 646 KB); size after extraction = 448 KB 
</uL>
<br>A workaround is to increase the value of the parameter Text Size on the Advanced page of the ODBC driver ASE 15. 
<br><br>

<li><strong>List report</strong>
<br>Multicolumn sort is not available. Sort uses only the first column.
<br><br>
HTML template for list report
<br>List reports generated in HTML format are based on a template. The interface does not allow you to easily change this template. The template used is the default one used for reports.
<br>In order to modify the HTML template used when generating a list report in HTML format, you must modify the default template for Report.
<br>Open the property sheet of any report, select the template you want to use, click the button "Set as default" and cancel.
<br><br>

<li><strong>J# redistributable</Strong>
<br>PowerDesigner redistributes Microsoft Visual J# Redistributable Package 2.0 for use in the autolayout function.
<br>If J# is removed, PowerDesigner can still be used but only a basic autolayout feature is available.
<br><br>

<li><strong>PowerDesigner installed on a network drive</strong>
<br>When PowerDesigner is run over a network, you must authorize network execution  before running it on a client computer.
<br>Use the caspol executable located in the Microsoft.net directory and run the following command:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caspol -m -ag LocalIntranet_Zone -url \\&lt;ServerName&gt;\&lt;FolderName&gt;\* FullTrust -n "&lt;Name&gt;" -d "&lt;Description&gt;"
<br>
<br>You must run PowerDesigner in administration mode (even if your user is an administrator) in order to be able to install a plug-in through Tools > General Options > Add-ins.
<br><br>

<li><strong>PowerDesigner project and file system</Strong>
<BR>PowerDesigner project content is not synchronized with the file system. It is a logical view of the project independent of the files' locations.
<bR>When used as an Eclipse plug-in or Visual Studio add-in, PowerDesigner project content is not synchronized with project content in Eclipse or Visual Studio.
<br><br>

<li><strong>Virtualization for Program files under Windows Vista/Seven and previous version of PowerDesigner</Strong>
<br>Prior to Windows Vista, when an application attempted to write in a protected directory such as c:\Program Files, it would fail due to insufficient access. 
<br>With PowerDesigner 16.1 and 16.0, PowerDesigner used the virtualization feature from Windows Vista and later Windows versions to redirect writes (and subsequent file or registry operations) to a per-user location within the users profile. 
<br>For example, if a user attempts to write to C:\Program Files\PowerDesigner 16\Resource files\DBMS, and the user does not have permission to write to that directory, the write will get redirected to C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\Sybase\PowerDesigner 16\Resource files\DBMS. 
<br>For the registry, if an application attempts to write to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\sybase\PowerDesigner 16 it will automatically get redirected to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\VirtualStore\MACHINE\Software\Sybase\PowerDesigner 16 or HKEY_USERS\UserSID_Classes\VirtualStore\Machine\Software\sybase\PowerDesigner 16.
<br>The transparency of file virtualization makes PowerDesigner believe that it is writing to and reading from the protected resource, when in fact it is accessing the virtualized version. This may lead to mis-interpretations of file directory content. See this <A href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb756960.aspx>MSDN article on UAC technologies</A> for more information.
<br><br>This behavior has been removed from PowerDesigner 16.5. When a user attempt to write to C:\Program Files\PowerDesigner 16\Resource files\DBMS, the operation will fail due to insufficient access.
<br>If you previously used the virtualization feature to save your resource files, in order to still be able to see and use them, you must add your virtualstore location to the list of PowerDesigner resources, or copy the resource files to another directory and add that directory path.
<br><br>

<li><Strong>Problem Starting SySAM License Server</strong>
<br>[CR #572522] When starting the SySAM license server, this error may be reported:
<br>lmgrd is not running: Cannot connect to license server system. (-15,570:10035 "WinSock: Operation wouldblock")
<br>Sysam server setup includes IPv4 and IPv6 versions of the SySAM license server software. Use the sysam configure command to choose the version of the license server appropriate to your environment. By default, the IPv4 version of the license server is configured for use. You cannot properly use the IPv4 version of the license server if you have enabled IPv6 on the license server host. If this is the case:
<br>
<br>    * Disable the IPv6 TCP/IP protocol on the license server host.
<br>    * Use another Windows host that does not have IPv6 enabled.
<br>    * Use a Unix host for the license server. You can use the IPv4 version of the license even if both IPv4 and IPv6 are enabled on Unix
<br>If you are using the IPv6 version of the license server on a Windows host, you can access the license only through the IPv6 protocol. Any host with an IPv4-only network stack cannot obtain licenses from this IPv6 license server. To work around this issue, perform one of the following:
<br>
<br>    * Use a Unix host for the license server. License servers on Unix can serve licenses to both IPv4 and IPv6 client hosts.
<br>    * To use a Windows host for the license server, if you have both IPv4 and IPv6 clients to the license server, set up two license servers: one serving the IPv4 network and the other serving the IPv6 network.
<br>Note: Support for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is built into the latest versions of Microsoft Windows, and is available as part of service pack updates for earlier Windows releases. See Microsoft Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/network/bb530961.aspx.

<!--
<li><strong>License Server and PowerDesigner on Same Computer</strong>
<br>You cannot run PowerDesigner on a computer where a license server is installed.
<br>If you are using a stand-alone served or a mobile floating license and you work disconnected from the server, and if your workstation hosts other products that also use Flexlm served licenses, you may have problems when returning your license to the server.
<br><br>
-->

<li><strong>PowerDesigner Portal</strong>
<br>The PowerDesigner Portal requires JRE 7. PowerDesigner Portal setup will install JRE 7 if no JRE is installed. If the PowerDesigner setup has not installed JRE 7, the administrator will have to check that the server is properly configured to use JRE 7 (check JAVA_HOME content).
<br>The JDBC driver you select in setup or in the Database connection page in configuration parameters must be compatible with the JRE installed on your computer.
<br>
<br>Connection to Microsoft SQLServer requires a unified Microsoft JDBC driver that supports connections to all versions of Microsoft SQLServer and can be downloaded from <A TARGET=_blank HREF=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=99b21b65-e98f-4a61-b811-19912601fdc9&displaylang=en>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=99b21b65-e98f-4a61-b811-19912601fdc9&displaylang=en.</A>
<br>
<br>Deployment requires to set some options on the application server if it has not been installed by the PowerDesigner setup.
<br>For Tomcat: add 'set JAVA_OPTS= -Djava.awt.headless=false' in catalina.bat 
<br>For JBoss:  add 'set JAVA_OPTS= -Djava.awt.headless=false' in run.bat  (This is default script in JBoss so you don't need to add this value unless it has been previously changed)
<br>If not set, the display of descriptions and annotations will not be optimal in the PowerDesigner Portal.<br>
<br>On some computers you may have trouble starting JVM with Tomcat. 
<br>If you encounter the following error message in Tomcat log, you should add javas bin directory to the windows environment PATH variable:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failed creating java C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_07\bin\client\jvm.dll
